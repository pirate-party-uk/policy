Remove VAT From E-Books
=======================

Paper books are free from VAT yet e-books are not. A book should be 
defined by what it provides not the material that is used to produce it, 
and any tax on books is a tax on reading. Like paper books, e-books 
should be zero-rated for VAT as soon as possible. We will remove VAT 
from e-books.
