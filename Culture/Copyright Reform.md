Copyright Reform
=====================

We, the Pirate Party, are committed to reshaping copyright policies for the digital age, prioritizing accessibility, innovation, and fairness. We advocate for digital preservation, voluntary collective licensing, and clear exemptions for educational use to ensure long-term availability of cultural works and simplify licensing processes. Additionally, we push for user representation in policy-making and support open access to publicly-funded research to accelerate knowledge dissemination. We also advocate for fair use guidelines, interoperability requirements, and limitations on contractual override to provide legal certainty and empower users. Addressing challenges like AI-generated content and orphan works, we promote the expansion of the public domain and recognition of Creative Commons licenses. Furthermore, we call for international cooperation on copyright reform and consideration of reduced copyright terms to balance creators' rights with public access to culture and knowledge.
