Copyright Reform
===========
The Pirate Party UK advocates for comprehensive copyright reform, prioritizing a balance between creators' rights and public access to culture and knowledge. We propose policies enabling cultural institutions to preserve digital content, promoting voluntary collective licensing, and establishing clear exemptions for educational use. Supporting open access to publicly-funded research, interoperability requirements for digital platforms, and fair use guidelines are essential. Additionally, we aim to generally broaden copyright exceptions and shorten copyright terms. We also prioritize limiting contractual override, protecting artistic freedom, ensuring fair compensation for artists, and addressing AI-generated copyright challenges. Furthermore, we seek to expand the public domain, reform orphan works usage, integrate Creative Commons licenses. Establishing a digital-first sale doctrine and enhancing access to educational materials remain key objectives.
