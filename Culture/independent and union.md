Policy Statement: Self-Determination and Cooperation within the UK
==========

At the core of the Pirate Party UK's (PPUK) ideology lies a commitment to democratic principles, self-determination, and collaboration. We affirm the right to self-determination for the people of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland within the context of democratic processes. PPUK advocates for the establishment of a fair and transparent mechanism for independence, ensuring inclusivity and adherence to democratic principles for all nations within the United Kingdom. While respecting the right to self-determination, we also recognize the value of unity and cooperation among the UK's constituent nations. PPUK aims to maintain equitable power dynamics, foster an inclusive national identity, and promote resource sharing for common goals. We support continued devolution of power, establishment of a shared governance framework, and removal of impediments to democratic decision-making, such as Section 35 of the Scotland Act 1998. In the event of an independence referendum, we endorse unbiased information campaigns and emphasize ongoing dialogue and engagement with citizens. PPUK proposes a dynamic constitutional review process and highlights the mutual benefits of unity, extension of democratic mechanisms, cultural exchange, collaboration, and a united stance in international affairs. Additionally, we commit to addressing historical injustices and promoting cultural preservation within the UK.
