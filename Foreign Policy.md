**Foreign Policy**  
**General Principles**  
Pirates believe in the fundamental values of collective and democratic decision-making, support of human rights worldwide, free and fair elections. The cornerstone of our foreign policy is transparency, openness and non-confrontation.

We support participation and cooperation with countries on the international and transnational organisations such as Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, G20, United Nations etc. However, Pirates also recognise the flaws and short-giving that such organisations have done, and we call for improvements in transparency and voting (e.g veto rule in UN Security Council) in order to strengthen the organisation and achieve fair balance.

**Position: Britain and European Union**  
Pirates believe that Brexit was completely disastrous for the United Kingdom both economically and politically. While the criticisms of the European Union's structure and its effect on United Kingdom are not without reason, the consequences of Brexit have significantly damaged the economy, made the trading more complicated, and tarnished the reputation in the international stage.

While the full rejoining to EU at this stage seems unlikely, Pirates support the association with the European Economic Area, introduction of youth mobility schemes and resuming exchange programs such as Erasmus, and free trade.

**Position: Ukraine/Russia war**  
Pirates strongly condemn illegal and horrendous Russian invasion into Ukraine, and strongly support Ukraine in their heroic fight against Russian imperialism \- which has also affected other ethnic minorities in the country such as Crimean Tatars, Chechens, Ingushs etc.

We fully support the decision to supply weapons to Ukraine and strike critical manufacturing plants and logistics within Russian territory. We also call for greater and more robust support for Ukrainian refugees that has been far from coherent and consistent. (edited)

**Position: Israel and Palestine**  
Pirates recognise the complex nuances of the conflict that lasts for more than 70 years. Unfortunately, the certain actors in both sides (Hamas terrorist organisation and Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as Netanyahu and his far-right key figures with the support from some Western politicians) have done everything in their power to derail the peace efforts for their own power and benefit, and as a result of that innocent Palestinians and Israelis are being endlessly killed.

We support the initiative of a two state solution within 1967 borders, call for illegal settlements in the West Bank to be stopped and apply sanctions against those who built and populate those settlements, and advocate for the lasting peace in the Middle East between Israel and Arab countries. While the criticism of the Israeli government is important and welcomed, we strongly reject anti-Zionism in the form of completely denying the right for Jews to have their own state.

**Position: NATO**  
Pirates support British membership in NATO and its role as a defensive organisation \- and the war in Ukraine has demonstrated its importance. However, the aggression of individual members of NATO against other countries without the full consent of others must be condemned and criticised. In addition, the selection of NATO's general secretary is not democratic and done behind the curtains. It should be improved at the very least by open election of a candidacy from each country.
