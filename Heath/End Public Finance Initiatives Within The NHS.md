End Private Finance Initiatives Within The NHS
=============================================

The Pirate Party proposes to terminate Private Finance Initiatives (PFIs) within the NHS, citing evidence of their detrimental financial impact. Since 1997, £11 billion of NHS infrastructure has been constructed under PFIs, accumulating a total cost of £80 billion. These initiatives have often resulted in the NHS being bound to specific service providers, limiting flexibility and potentially inflating costs. The party pledges to cease the signing of new PFI agreements and to intervene urgently where existing inflated PFI expenses are adversely affecting NHS services, aiming to address financial inefficiencies and ensure optimal resource allocation within the healthcare system.
