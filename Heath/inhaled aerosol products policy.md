Inhaled Aerosol Products Policy Proposal
==========

The proposal advocates for stringent regulation of inhaled aerosol products like vaping, e-cigarettes, and smoking due to concerns regarding their safety, quality, and impact on public health. It highlights the need for designated non-smoking areas in public buildings, workplaces, and entertainment venues to protect individuals from exposure to secondhand smoke and other aerosols. Specific measures include prohibiting the use of these products in outdoor areas of hospitals and creating non-smoking streets in areas with documented air quality issues, with local councils empowered to enforce such regulations. Licensing for entertainment venues to permit limited use of inhaled aerosol products is proposed, contingent on the implementation of air filtering systems to mitigate secondary air quality concerns. Additionally, allowances are made for medical use with proper prescription, while exempting inhalers prescribed for respiratory conditions from these restrictions. Overall, the proposal underscores the necessity of addressing the health risks associated with inhaled aerosol products through comprehensive regulatory measures.
