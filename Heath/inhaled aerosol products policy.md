# Inhaled Aerosol Products Policy Proposal

## Regulation of Inhaled Aerosol Products:
- Inhaled aerosol products, including vaping, e-cigarettes, and smoking, should be subject to strict regulation to ensure safety, quality, and age restrictions.
- Public buildings, workplaces, and retail/entertainment venues should be designated as non-smoking areas for all inhaled aerosol products, with exceptions as outlined below.

## Restrictions on Inhaled Aerosol Products Near Hospitals:

- The use of inhaled aerosol products, including vaping, e-cigarettes, and smoking, should be prohibited in all outdoor areas of a hospital's grounds.
- Additionally, a 30-meter radius surrounding hospital entrances on publicly-owned lands should be designated as non-smoking areas for all inhaled aerosol products.

## Designation of Non-Smoking Streets:
- Local councils should have the authority to designate specific streets as non-smoking areas for inhaled aerosol products.
- These designations may include time-sensitive aspects, similar to parking restrictions on certain streets.
- The primary focus should be on shopping center streets with documented air quality issues.

## Licensing for Entertainment Venues:
- Local councils should be empowered to grant "inhaled aerosol product licenses" to entertainment venues, including pubs and nightclubs.
- The number of licenses issued should not exceed 10% of the total venues in the council's jurisdiction.
- Licensees must demonstrate the use of air filtering and air conditioning systems to prevent secondary air quality issues for people outside the venue.

## Medical Use of Inhaled Aerosol Products:
- In exceptional cases where there is clear medical necessity, the use of inhaled aerosol products for medical purposes should be allowed.
- Medical prescriptions should be required for such use, ensuring that patients receive the appropriate treatment.
- Inhalers prescribed for respiratory conditions are exempt from these restrictions.
