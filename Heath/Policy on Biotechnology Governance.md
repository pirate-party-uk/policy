# Policy on Biotechnology Governance

Biotechnology's potential is immense, yet its unchecked advancement poses significant risks. Our policy prioritizes responsible governance to mitigate these dangers. We advocate for strict controls on genetic data accessibility, international cooperation to set global standards, and robust regulation of genetic manipulation, including gene editing. Moreover, we emphasize the importance of early detection and rapid response mechanisms for pandemic threats, alongside investments in preventive technologies like nanofilters and UV lamps. Lastly, we stress the need for public education on biotechnology's risks and ethical considerations. Through these measures, we aim to harness biotechnology's benefits while safeguarding society and the environment.
