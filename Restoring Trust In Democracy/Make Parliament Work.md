Make Parliament Work
======

To bolster the quality of parliamentary and legal decisions, we advocate for thorough pre-decision scrutiny for all proposals, prioritizing evidence-backed decision-making. Failure to adhere to this process risks substantial harm to individuals, as evidenced by the consequences of disregarding expert advice.


To further strengthen the legislative process, we propose implementing the remaining recommendations of the Wright report by establishing a House business committee in the Commons and adopting the recommendations outlined in the Goodlad report for the Lords. Additionally, we suggest instituting a House business committee in the Lords and incorporating an evidence-taking stage for all bills alongside pre-legislative scrutiny. These measures aim to ensure comprehensive consideration of evidence and expertise in parliamentary decision-making, fostering more informed and effective legislation.


We would require the maintenanceof a register of lobbyists as well as a record of all meetings between lobbyists and  legislators or government officials.
