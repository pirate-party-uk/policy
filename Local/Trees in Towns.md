Trees in Towns
========

The Pirate Party UK is dedicated to fostering green urban spaces through a comprehensive approach to tree planting and maintenance. We advocate for community-led initiatives that empower local residents to actively participate in tree planting programs, ensuring diverse species are selected to enhance urban biodiversity and resilience. By prioritizing ongoing care and protection of urban trees, setting canopy cover targets, and integrating green infrastructure, we aim to improve air quality, mitigate climate change, and create vibrant towns where residents take pride in their green surroundings.
