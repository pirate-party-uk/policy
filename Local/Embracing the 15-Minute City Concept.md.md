# Embracing the 15-Minute City Concept

## Introduction
The Pirate Party UK recognizes the importance of adopting innovative urban planning concepts that promote sustainability, improve the quality of life for city dwellers, and reduce car dependency. The 15-Minute City (15mC) concept aligns with our values of individual freedom, environmental responsibility, and community well-being. In this draft, we outline our commitment to incorporating the 15-Minute City concept into our local policy agenda.

## 1. Local Accessibility
We believe that residents of our cities should have easy access to daily necessities and services without being dependent on cars. We commit to:

- Encouraging local government authorities to work towards ensuring that most essential services, such as work, shopping, education, healthcare, and leisure, are accessible within a 15-minute walk, bike ride, or public transit ride from any point in the city.

## 2. Multi-Disciplinary Approach
To successfully implement the 15-Minute City concept, we understand the need for collaboration across various disciplines. We commit to:

- Advocating for the integration of transportation planning, urban design, and policymaking to create well-designed public spaces, pedestrian-friendly streets, and mixed-use developments.

## 3. Support for Remote Work
We recognize that the recent widespread availability of information and communications technology has enabled remote working. We commit to:

- Supporting policies that encourage remote work, reducing the need for daily commuting and contributing to a more sustainable and flexible lifestyle.

## 4. Preservation of Local Way of Life
The 15-Minute City concept emphasizes a return to a local way of life. We commit to:

- Promoting policies that preserve and celebrate local communities, fostering a sense of belonging and connection within neighborhoods.

## 5. Building upon Tradition
We acknowledge that the roots of the 15-Minute City concept can be traced back to pre-modern urban planning traditions. We commit to:

- Drawing inspiration from these traditions, New Urbanism, transit-oriented development, and similar pedestrian-centered principles to create livable, walkable communities.

## 6. Neighborhood Development
We understand the importance of neighborhood development in building 15-Minute Cities. We commit to:

- Advocating for the creation of smaller 5-minute neighborhoods, also known as complete communities or walkable neighborhoods, as integral components of the 15-Minute City concept.

## 7. Promoting Transparency and Accessibility
We emphasize the importance of transparency and accessibility in policy implementation. We commit to:

- Supporting initiatives that ensure residents' active participation in the planning and development processes, allowing for community input and feedback.

## Conclusion
The Pirate Party UK is dedicated to fostering urban environments that promote well-being, sustainability, and personal freedom. We believe that the 15-Minute City concept is a promising approach to achieving these goals. By incorporating this concept into our local policy agenda, we aim to contribute to a future where cities are vibrant, accessible, and centered around the well-being of their residents.
