# Open Websites and Information Access Policy

As the Pirate Party UK, we wholeheartedly endorse this policy promoting open access to information on council websites. We firmly believe that information should be freely available to all, without unnecessary restrictions or barriers. By advocating against copy-and-paste restrictions and encouraging the use of Creative Commons licensing, we strive to ensure that public information remains accessible and shareable for the benefit of all citizens. We commend the commitment to transparency and openness outlined in this policy and urge other councils to adopt similar principles to uphold the values of democracy and informed citizenship.
