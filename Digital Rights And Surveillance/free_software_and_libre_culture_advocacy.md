# Policy Statement: Free Software and Libre Culture Advocacy

## Must:
1. **Promotion of  Open Source Software:** PPUK strongly supports the adoption, development, and promotion of  Open Source Software. We believe that software should be accessible, modifiable, and distributable by all users, ensuring their control over their own technical systems.
   
2. **User Autonomy and Privacy:** PPUK emphasizes the significance of open source in enhancing users' autonomy and privacy. We advocate for open source as a means to empower users to take charge of their digital environments and protect their privacy from undue surveillance.

3. **Cultivating Free Culture:** PPUK is committed to fostering a free culture that nurtures creativity, education, and cultural diversity. We recognize the importance of art and culture in enriching society, and we aim to create an environment where artistic expression and cultural contributions are free to flourish.

## Should:
1. **Education and Outreach:** PPUK should actively engage in educational initiatives to raise awareness about the benefits of open source and free culture. We should provide resources, workshops, and information to the public, promoting the adoption of open source and encouraging participation in libre cultural activities.

2. **Collaboration and Innovation:** PPUK should encourage collaboration within the open source community and among artists and creators. By fostering a collaborative environment, we can drive innovation and create diverse solutions that benefit society as a whole.

## Could:
1. **Legislative Advocacy:** PPUK could advocate for legislative measures that support the use and development of open source and protect the rights of creators within the realm of free culture. This may include lobbying for policies that promote open standards and interoperability.

2. **Support for Libre Cultural Projects:** PPUK could offer support, both in terms of resources and promotion, to projects that align with our goals of fostering free culture. This may involve collaborating with artists, educators, and cultural institutions to create platforms and events that showcase libre cultural works.

## Like:
1. **Balanced Innovation:** PPUK would like to strike a balance between promoting open source and free culture while not suppressing commercial innovation within the tech and cultural sectors. We support open source and free culture, yet recognize the coexistence of various models, encouraging creativity and accessibility.

2. **Inclusive Approach:** PPUK would like to adopt an inclusive approach that welcomes diverse perspectives within the tech and cultural communities. We aim to foster dialogue and cooperation that ultimately benefits all stakeholders involved.
