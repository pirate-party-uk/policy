Right To Marriage Regardless Of Sexuality
=========================================

All of the UK's citizens should have an equal right to marriage. The 
implementation of truly equal marriage must not be further delayed or 
de-prioritised. Equal marriage must mean exactly that. The law must be 
changed to give full equality to all couples regardless of gender.
