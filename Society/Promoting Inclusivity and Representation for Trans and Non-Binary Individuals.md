# Promoting Inclusivity and Representation for Trans and Non-Binary Individuals

Recognizing the need for comprehensive healthcare for trans and non-binary individuals, the Pirate Party advocates for a policy that addresses the limitations and challenges currently faced within the NHS regarding trans care.

## Community Consultation:
- The Pirate Party emphasizes the importance of engaging with the trans and non-binary community, advocacy groups, and healthcare professionals to develop and refine policies related to their healthcare.
- Their insights and experiences should be considered in shaping policies to ensure the provision of equitable and person-centered care.

By implementing these policies, including legal identity change (self-ID) and a non-binary/third gender option available as a voluntary opt-in, the Pirate Party aims to address the current gaps and limitations in trans and non-binary healthcare within the NHS. We strive to ensure that all individuals have access to comprehensive and timely care from knowledgeable healthcare professionals while respecting their gender identity and self-determination.
