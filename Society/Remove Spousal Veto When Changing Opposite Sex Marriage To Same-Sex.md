Remove Spousal Veto When Changing Opposite Sex Marriage To Same-Sex
===================================================================

Marriage law is not yet equal marriage as it fails to meet the needs of 
transgender people. Currently, an "opposite-sex" marriage is considered 
different to a "same-sex" marriage. This means unless the spouse agrees, 
the person must choose between their marriage and gender recognition. 
This is not a problem in Scotland, and we would fix the problem 
nation-wide.
