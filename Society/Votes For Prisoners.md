Votes For Prisoners
===================

Stopping prisoners from voting violates their human rights (ECHR, 
Protocol 1, Article 3) the UK government has ignored repeated rulings 
against them by the European Court of Human Rights. We believe that 
voting is a fundamental right for all people, including prisoners. 
Prisoners would be permitted to vote in the constituency they were 
registered in prior to incarceration.
