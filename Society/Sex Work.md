Sex Work
===============

The Pirate Party UK advocates for the full decriminalization of sex work, highlighting its alignment with individual autonomy, bodily integrity, and labor rights. They emphasize the need to prioritize the safety, health, and well-being of sex workers through access to support services and legal protections. Concerns are raised regarding the negative consequences of legalization, such as perpetuating a two-tier system that marginalizes vulnerable individuals. The party proposes cooperative workspaces and homes for safer engagement in sex work and emphasizes empowering sex workers with control over their earnings. They cite support from international organizations like Amnesty International and the World Health Organization and stress the importance of comprehensive education and awareness programs to challenge stereotypes and promote understanding. Focus is placed on addressing exploitation and improving working conditions for migrant sex workers, combating exploitation while recognizing the importance of labor rights and protections for all workers in the industry.
