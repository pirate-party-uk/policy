Efficiently Process Asylum Seekers And Treat Them Properly
==========================================================

Quite rightly, the UK is a party to international agreements pertaining 
to asylum. We have an obligation to provide sanctuary to those 
individuals who have been forced to flee their homes. We should ensure 
that those people who come to the UK seeking asylum are treated fairly 
and are given decisions quickly about their status. Once asylum seekers 
have been granted asylum they should be given assistance to ensure that 
their time in the UK is productive and beneficial to them and the UK, 
including access to employment and education.
