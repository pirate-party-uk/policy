Sure Start
==========

We must protect Sure Start services. It is vitally important that all 
children get the best possible start in life, but that alone isn't 
sufficient in dealing with the problems that the UK faces. The rationale 
under which Sure Start Children's Centres were set up should be 
extended, not rolled back. They have made life easier for millions of 
families and could improve lives further. Sure Start should be be about 
actively bringing down the levels of child poverty in the UK, not just 
a start in life, and should provide ongoing support for whole families.
