Protect The Right To Protest
============================

The right to protest and express dissent without fear of reprisal is 
fundamental to a democratic society and the exercise of freedom of 
speech. The Pirate Party seeks to uphold and protect this right, 
wherever people wish to make use of it. Withholding labour is also part 
of the tradition of protest and must also be protected.
