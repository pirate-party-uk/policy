Public CCTV Cameras
===================

A [2013 report from the College of Policing](http://library.college.police.uk/docs/what-works/What-works-briefing-effects-of-CCTV-2013.pdf) 
revealed that "CCTV can lead to a small reduction in crime" but "has no effect 
on violent crime". Because of this we would refocus police resources on 
preventing crime through more effective measures. We would also tightly regulate 
CCTV installations covering public areas as there should be little reason to 
use it. These stricter requirements would mean that many existing installations 
would be removed.
