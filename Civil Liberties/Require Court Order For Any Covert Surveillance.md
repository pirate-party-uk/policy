Require Court Order For Any Covert Surveillance
===============================================

Any body, including the police, should be required to obtain a court 
order in order to perform any covert surveillance of specific 
individuals. Where obtaining a warrant would prevent the police acting 
on an immediate threat or pursuing a lead in an investigation, a court 
order should be obtained alongside the ongoing surveillance and, if 
denied, the subject of the surveillance must be informed. The court 
order required should be proportional to the amount of surveillance, the
degree of the suspected offence and the amount of evidence against the 
individual.
