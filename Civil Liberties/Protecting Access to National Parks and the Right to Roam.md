Protecting Access to National Parks and the Right to Roam
====================

The protection and accessibility of our national parks are paramount to preserving our natural heritage. Recognizing the importance of ensuring equal access and enjoyment for all, we advocate for the enshrinement of the right to roam within these landscapes, safeguarding against unnecessary restrictions imposed by landowners. Moreover, we endorse responsible wild camping practices within designated areas, aiming to foster a deeper connection with nature and instill a sense of stewardship. Addressing concerns over land ownership concentration, we propose measures to limit large-scale ownership within national parks, thus preventing restricted access and commercial exploitation. By investing in education and outreach programs, we aim to cultivate appreciation and awareness among both children and adults, nurturing a commitment to the preservation of our natural wonders for future generations. These policies, grounded in evidence of the societal benefits of equitable park access and environmental conservation, strive to create a fair and inclusive approach to the management of our national parks, ensuring that they remain cherished and accessible to all.
