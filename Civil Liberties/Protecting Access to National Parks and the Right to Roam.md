# Protecting Access to National Parks and the Right to Roam
====================
## Introduction
Our party is committed to preserving and enhancing the natural beauty and accessibility of our national parks. We believe that these incredible natural spaces should be open and accessible to all, and the rights of the people to roam and enjoy these areas should be protected. To achieve this, we propose the following policies:

## 1. Enshrine the Right to Roam
We will pass legislation to enshrine the right to roam in national parks. This will guarantee that individuals have the freedom to explore and appreciate the beauty of our natural landscapes without unnecessary restrictions imposed by landowners.

## 2. Wild Camping in National Parks
We support the right to wild camp responsibly within national parks. We will work to create a legal framework that allows camping in designated areas while preserving the natural environment. This will enable people to connect with nature, experience the beauty of the night sky, and instill a sense of stewardship for our natural heritage.

## 3. Restrict Land Ownership in National Parks
We believe that the concentration of land ownership within national parks can lead to restricted access and commercial exploitation. We will explore measures to limit large-scale land ownership in these areas, ensuring that national parks remain accessible and are not turned into commodities for profit.

## 4. Education and Outreach
To encourage future generations to appreciate and protect our national parks, we will invest in education and outreach programs. These initiatives will provide opportunities for children and adults to experience the wonders of our natural world, fostering a deeper connection with the environment.

## Conclusion
Our party is dedicated to preserving the natural beauty of our national parks and ensuring that they are accessible to all. By enshrining the right to roam, permitting responsible wild camping, restricting excessive land ownership, and investing in education, we aim to create a legacy that allows future generations to enjoy and protect these natural treasures.

We believe that these policies will lead to a fair and inclusive approach to our national parks, ensuring that the privileged do not have an undue advantage over others when it comes to enjoying the beauty of our natural landscapes.
