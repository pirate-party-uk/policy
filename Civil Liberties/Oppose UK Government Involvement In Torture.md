Oppose UK Government Involvement In Torture
===========================================

Torture is of course contrary to Human Rights. The Gibson Report showed 
that MI5 and MI6 officers were complicit in torturing detainees. It 
would be a criminal offence to take part in intelligence operations 
involving torture. This would include "indirect torture" where foreign, 
collaborating agencies perform torture.
