Accountability and Transparency Policy for Legislation
========

In adherence to evidence-based governance, the Pirate Party presents the Accountability and Transparency Policy for Legislation. This policy mandates seeking expert advice on all legislative matters, particularly those with significant implications. Should enact legislation cause greater harm than taking no action, fines and liabilities are imposed, emphasizing the necessity of informed decision-making.

This policy prioritizes expert consultation and accountability, ensuring that legislative actions are guided by expertise and minimize potential harm to the public.
