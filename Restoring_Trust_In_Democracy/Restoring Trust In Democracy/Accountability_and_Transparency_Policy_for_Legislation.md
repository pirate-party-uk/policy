Accountability and Transparency Policy for Legislation
===============
Proposing the Accountability and Transparency Policy for Legislation, the Pirate Party underscores the imperative of evidence-based decision-making and citizen involvement in shaping laws. This policy mandates Members of Parliament, Lords, and political parties to actively seek expert guidance on all legislative matters, particularly those with significant implications.

Under this proposal, rigorous impact assessments are conducted to evaluate the potential effects of proposed bills. The findings of these assessments are made publicly accessible, enhancing transparency and fostering informed public discourse. Furthermore, mechanisms for accountability are established, including fines and liability for any harm caused by legislation passed against expert advice.

This framework emphasizes the importance of informed governance and seeks to ensure that legislative decisions are made responsibly, with due consideration given to expert analysis and public input.
