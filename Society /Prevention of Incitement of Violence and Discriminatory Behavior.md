 Prevention of Incitement of Violence and Discriminatory Behavior
 ===========================
 
The Pirate Party UK recognizes the critical importance of preventing the incitement of violence and discriminatory behaviour and upholding the principles of equality and non-discrimination. In this spirit, we propose an amendment to the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, the Equality Act, and the Football Offences Act to include "adoption," "having/getting an abortion," "immigration status," "marital or civil partnership status", and "refugee status" as protected characteristics. We advocate for expanded protection to include attributes such as age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity, and variations in sex characteristics. Additionally, we believe that exceptions in the Equality Act should be based on evidence and fairness. We also propose legislation that introduces new offences targeting the stirring up of hatred against these groups, with a threshold for prosecution encompassing threatening, abusive, or insulting conduct or material. We pledge to engage with minority communities to address concerns, ensuring that our approach is practical and sensitive to their needs as we strive to foster a society built on inclusivity and respect.
