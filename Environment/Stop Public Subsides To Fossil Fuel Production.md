Stop Public Subsides To Fossil Fuel Production
=======

We advocate for ending public subsidies to fossil fuel production, aligning with efforts to address environmental challenges. This entails ceasing the issuance of new licenses for oil, gas, and other fossil fuel exploration and production, alongside discontinuing Field Allowances. Additionally, tax rates on profits from oil and gas, including the Ring Fence Corporation Tax, Supplementary Charge, and Petroleum Revenue Tax, will be increased significantly. By doing so, we aim to encourage a shift toward sustainable energy sources, ensuring both environmental stewardship and fiscal accountability.
