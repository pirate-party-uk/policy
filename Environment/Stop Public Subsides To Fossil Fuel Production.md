Stop Public Subsides To Fossil Fuel Production
=================

The Pirate Party UK staunchly advocates for the cessation of public subsidies to fossil fuel production, aligning with our commitment to environmental stewardship and the urgency of addressing climate change. We stand firm in our proposal to discontinue Field Allowances and significantly increase taxation rates on oil and gas profits, including the implementation of measures such as the Supplementary Charge and Petroleum Revenue Tax. Additionally, we adamantly oppose the issuance of new licenses for fossil fuel exploration and production, recognizing the imperative to transition towards sustainable energy alternatives. Our objective is to promote responsible fiscal practices while driving forward the imperative shift towards a greener and more sustainable energy landscape.
