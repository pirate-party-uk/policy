Increase and Renew Nuclear Fission-Based Energy Production Plan
==========================================================

The Pirate Party advocates for an evidence-based approach to revitalize nuclear fission-based energy production. This plan emphasizes decommissioning ageing and unsafe reactors, transitioning away from polluting coal and oil-based power stations, and increasing capacity with modern designs like Advanced Boiling Water Reactors (ABWR) or Water-Water Energetic Reactors (WWER). Implementation includes integrating nuclear reprocessing to reduce waste, maintaining stringent safety and security measures, and ensuring efficient grid integration. Public engagement and education efforts aim to address concerns and promote understanding, while ongoing maintenance, upgrades, and research focus on improving safety and efficiency. Environmental impact mitigation measures and international collaboration on safety and non-proliferation standards are also prioritized, alongside long-term waste management planning.
