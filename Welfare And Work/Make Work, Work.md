Make Work, Work
===============

Currently, 29% young people in the UK live in poverty, and 12.8%	
young adults are unemployed, yet even when they do find work at the 
minimum wage, they are paid far less than older workers. Nobody should 
be priced out of an adequate standard of living, especially not on the 
basis of age. We will object to discrimination within the benefits 
system for anyone not in full time education or retirement.
