Move Toward A Universal Basic Income
=======

The current economic system faces challenges such as inadequate wages that force many individuals into poverty despite being employed. This results in government subsidies for employers and complex benefits systems. Advocates propose addressing this by ensuring a living wage for all, simplifying the benefits system, and ultimately implementing a Universal Basic Income (UBI) to provide unconditional support to citizens. UBI aims to alleviate poverty, promote flexibility in employment, and streamline welfare administration, potentially offsetting the need for high minimum wages and complex tax codes. However, funding through tax increases and wealth redistribution raises questions about feasibility and incentive structures, necessitating comprehensive research and incremental approaches.
